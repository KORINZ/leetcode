Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1,
find all possible paths from node 0 to node n - 1 and return them in any order.

The graph is given as follows: graph[i] is a list of all nodes you can visit from node i
(i.e., there is a directed edge from node i to node graph[i][j]).
