https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-window-substring/
Given two strings s and t of lengths m and n respectively, return the minimum window
substring of s such that every character in t (including duplicates) is included in the window.
If there is no such substring, return the empty string "".
The testcases will be generated such that the answer is unique.
s and t consist of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
